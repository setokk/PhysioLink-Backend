            This is the official PhysioLink <span class="highlighted">Android</span> documentation.

            <h2>Assumptions</h2>
            <p>During development, several assumptions were made in order 
                to speed up the development of the project.
                These assumptions though don't impact the project's extendability or
                ability to adapt to change in the future, since various design principles
                were folllowed (<span class="highlighted">Message Delegation</span>,
                <span class="highlighted">SRP</span>, <span class="highlighted">Composition</span>)
                and many more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of these assumptions include:
            </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Each doctor/clinic has a standard available hours schedule.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekdays -> 9:00 AM to 17:00 PM (8 hours)
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday -> 9:00 AM to 13:00 PM (4 hours)
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday -> No available hours (0 hours)
            </li>
            <li>
                There aren't any loading screen indicators.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While their implementation would not be hard (wait for all API calls to finish with syncronized methods),
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they would need to be implemented in 20 fragments, more or less.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the project is structured, we can easily do that in the future using each fragment's
                <br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ViewModel class, since they are responsible for data fetching
            </li>
            <li>
                Patients can only request one appointment at a time.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restriction was implemented in order to reduce spamming from patients.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also implemented to make things simpler, as showing an appointment
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour available to many patients can lead to the doctor choosing one
                <br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and declining the others. This can also result in poor user experience.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once an appointment request is made, we consider it taken. Only and only when
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the appointment is declined by the doctor, the appointment hour can be considered available again
            </li>
            <li>
                Patients can only have one doctor
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assumption was made in regards to the initial requests of the client (PSF).
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the development was made easier. 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This constraint can change to support multiple doctors, changing the patient creation system (patients would register by themselves).
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also require for the database to change (adding a table has_doctor). 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this change seems like the most challenging one, it can be done without
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changing the whole system and database as a whole
            </li>

            <li>Notification system: Users receive a notification when:
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctor: A patient requested an appointment
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: Their doctor accepted their appointment

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient: Their doctor made a payment for their confirmed appointment

            <li>Email system: Users' emails receive messages
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create/edit a patient and doctor with your email to see

        <div class="center-part">
            <h2>Design Choices</h2>
            In order to make the code modular, the project has 3 basic activities:
        </div>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>PSFActivity: Home to all fragments that are PSF related</li>

            <li>PatientActivity: Home to all fragments that are Patient related</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <div class="center-part">
            Other activities include:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>MainActivity: Redirects the user to their appropriate activity <i>(using user.ser)</i> if they are logged in, else redirects to the LoginActivity</li>
            <li>LoginActivity: Login activity that handles the authentication with the help of auth classes</li>
